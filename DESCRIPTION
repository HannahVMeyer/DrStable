Description: The analysis of high-dimensional datasets often requires to extract
    meaningful variables from the data or compress the data into a more
    tractable number of features. In technical terms, for a high-dimensional
    dataset X with N samples and P dimensions (traits), dimensionality reduction
    techniques aim: i) to provide a meaningful low-dimensional representation Z
    of K dimensions while only losing minor amounts of information, ii) to use
    only a small number of free parameters, iii) to preserve the quantities of
    interest in the data. There are a variety of approaches for dimensionality
    reduction with different underlying mathematical concepts and parameters.
    This package provides a simple function to access 12 dimensionality
    reduction methods (DiffusionMap, DRR, ICA, LLE, Isomap, LaplacianEigenmap,
    MDS, PCA, kPCA, nMDS, tSNE and UMAP). It introduces a new stability
    criterion, which identifies the lower dimensional componet Z that can
    reliably be found in cross-validation on different subsets of M samples and
    P traits.
